# TODOApp based on IndexedDB
IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. 
This API uses indexes to enable high-performance searches of this data. 
While Web Storage is useful for storing smaller amounts of data, it is less useful for storing larger amounts of structured data. IndexedDB provides a solution.
